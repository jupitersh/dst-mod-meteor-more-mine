# Meteor More Mine

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Meteor will bring more rocks, flints, gold nuggets, nitre, marble and gems.

Be aware, this doesn't change the basic drop of the meteor. It only adds additional drops.

Do not make the dropping probability too high, or your meteor area may flood with mines.
